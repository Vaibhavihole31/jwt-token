JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It's a way to securely transmit information between two parties, usually a server and a client, in a compact and self-contained format. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs.

Think of a JWT token as a small digital passport that carries information about a user. It's like a piece of paper that contains important details. The token is created by the server and given to the client after a successful login or authentication process.

A JWT token consists of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature.

Header: The header contains information about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing the token.

Payload: The payload is where the actual data is stored. It contains claims, which are statements about the user and additional metadata. Claims can include things like the user's ID, username, role, or any other relevant information. The payload is encoded using Base64Url encoding, which makes it compact and easy to transmit.

Signature: The signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token and ensure it hasn't been tampered with. The server signs the token using a secret key or a private key known only to the server. The client can verify the token's integrity by checking the signature using the corresponding public key or shared secret.

When a client wants to access a protected resource, it includes the JWT token in the request. The server then validates the token's signature, extracts the information from the payload, and uses that information to determine if the client is authorized to access the requested resource.

One advantage of JWT tokens is that they are self-contained, meaning the server doesn't need to store session information or query a database to validate the token. This makes JWT tokens efficient and scalable.

In summary, JWT tokens are like digital passports that securely carry information about a user. They are used for authentication and authorization in web applications, and they consist of a header, payload, and signature. The server signs the token, and the client can use it to access protected resources by validating the token's signature and extracting the information it contains.
